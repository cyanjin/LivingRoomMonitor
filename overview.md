Use a Raspberry Pi to detect who has been in your room! A Raspberry Pi is so small that it can easily be hidden, making it ideal for secretly detecting unwanted visitors to your bedroom (like parents).

In this tutorial you will make a parent detector that uses motion detection to trigger video recording via the Raspberry Pi Camera Board. You can then leave the Pi hidden in your room and see who's been caught on camera when you get home from school.
